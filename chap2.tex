\section{The \LHC}
The Large Hadron Collider (\LHC) at \CERN is a new hadron collider,
located in the same tunnel as the Large Electron-Positron collider
(\LEP)~\cite{Brianti:2004qq}. Where \LEP's chief task was the use
of \unit{90--207}{\GeV} \epluseminus collisions to establish the
precision physics of electroweak unification\dots

\section{The \LHCb experiment}
\label{sec:LHCbInDetail}

Since both \bhadron{s} are preferentially produced in the same direction
and are forward-boosted along the beam-pipe, the detector is not required
to have full $4\pi$ solid-angle coverage. \LHCb takes advantage of this
by using a wedge-shaped single-arm detector with angular acceptance
\unit{10-300}{\mrad} in the horizontal (bending) plane~\cite{Amato:1998xt}.

The detector is illustrated in \FigureRef{fig:LHCbCrossSection}, showing
the overall scale of the experiment and the surrounding cavern structure.

The single-sided detector design was chosen in preference to a two-armed
design since the detector dimensions are restricted by the layout of the
IP8 (ex-Delphi) cavern in which \LHCb is located. Using all the available
space for a single-arm spectrometer more than compensates in performance
for the \about{50\percent} drop in luminosity.

\section{The \Cerenkov mechanism}
A Huygens construction in terms of spherical shells of probability for photon
emission as the particle progresses along its track shows an effective
``shock-front'' of \Cerenkov emission. This corresponds to an emission cone of
opening angle \thetaCerenkov around the momentum vector for each point on the
track,
%
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:cosThetaCk}
  \begin{equation}
    \cos\,\thetaCerenkov  &= \frac{1}{n \beta} +
                             \frac{\hbar k}{2p}%
                             \parenths{ 1 - \frac{1}{n^2} } \\
                          &\,\sim \frac{1}{n \beta}%
    \label{eq:cosThetaCkApprox}
  \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
%
where $\beta \equiv v/c$, the relativistic velocity fraction,
