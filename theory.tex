Some stuff about the SM

\section{Electroweak symmetry breaking}
\label{sec:ewbreaking}
We can go a long way with an effective Hamiltonian approach in
canonical single-particle quantum mechanics. To do this we construct
a wavefunction from a combination of a generic neutral meson state 
$\ket{\Xzero}$ and its anti-state $\ket{\Xzerobar}$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\psi(t)} = a(t)\ket{\Xzero} + b(t)\ket{\Xzerobar}
\end{equation}
%
which is governed by a time-dependent matrix differential equation,
%
\begin{equation}
  \I \pdByd{}{t} \colvector{a \\ b}
  =
  \underbrace{%
  \twomatrix{ M_{11}-\frac{\I}{2}\Gamma_{11}           
            & M_{12}-\frac{\I}{2}\Gamma_{12} }
            { M_{12}^\ast-\frac{\I}{2}\Gamma_{12}^\ast 
            & M_{22}-\frac{\I}{2}\Gamma_{22} }
  }_{\boldmatrix{H}}
  \colvector{a \\ b}
  .
\end{equation}
