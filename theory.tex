\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{sec:theSM}

The \ac{SM} of fundamental interactions is the theory
which describes the electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear interactions, often
represented as a collection of the elementary particles predicted by the theory.
The \ac{SM} has successfully described data from a wide range of experiments, and in the 
years prior to the LHC, all of the predicted elementary particles were verified 
except for one: the Higgs boson. This chapter briefly describes the theory
behind the \ac{SM} and the Higgs mechanism, before discussing previous
experimental results in \ac{SM} Higgs boson searches and a outlining the theory
and motivation behind a possible extension to the \ac{SM} - the \ac{MSSM}.

\subsection{Particles and Forces} 
\label{sec:particlesandforces}

The \ac{SM} is a renormalisable quantum field theory, in which the constituents of
matter are represented as spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions which interact with
forces mediated by spin-1 bosons. These interactions are described by a
Lagrangian which is invariant under $SU(3)_{C} \times SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)_{Y}$
symmetries. The $SU(3)_{C}$ part describes the strong interaction, mediated by
particles which carry colour charge (C). In these interactions, described by the
theory of \ac{QCD}~\cite{Griffiths:2008nx,Perkins:2000uq}, the force mediators are massless gluons
and the coloured fermions are the quarks. A notable property of QCD interactions
is confinement, in which the coupling strength decreases and the interaction
becomes asymptotically free at high energy, leading to quarks being bound at 
small distances in hadrons \cite{Gross:1973id,Politzer:1973fx}. The remaining fundamental fermions,
the leptons, do not carry colour charge and hence do not interact via the strong
force. Both the leptons and quarks participate in electroweak interactions,
which are governed by the $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)_{Y}$ symmetry.

The electroweak symmetry describes the unified electromagnetic and weak
interactions~\cite{GlashowPartialSymmetries,WeinbergModelOfLeptons,SalamNobelSymposium}, 
and was one of the major achievements of the twentieth
century in the \ac{SM}. In electroweak theory the quantum numbers of interest are
weak isospin $t_{1,2,3}$ and hypercharge $y$. These are related to the
electric charge Q as: 

\begin{equation}
Q = t_{3} + \frac{y}{2}
\end{equation}

The gauge fields associated with these quantum numbers are the three weak isospin fields,
$W_{\mu}^{i}$, $i = 1,2,3$, and the hypercharge field $B_{\mu}$. The weak
isospin fields act on doublets: 

\begin{equation}
\psi_{L} =  \begin{pmatrix} u_{i} \\ d_{i} \end{pmatrix}_{L} ,   
\begin{pmatrix} \nu_{i} \\ {l_{i}} \end{pmatrix}_{L}
\end{equation}

where $u_{i}$ are the up-type quarks ($u,c,t$), $d_{i}$ are the down-type quarks
($d,s,b$), $l_{i}$ are the charged leptons ($e,\mu,\tau$) and $\nu_{i}$ are the
corresponding neutrinos ($\nu_{e},\nu_{\mu},\nu_{\tau}$). The index $i$ indicates first, second or third
generation fermions. The subscript $L$ indicates that the doublets correspond to
the left handed projection of the fermions. The weak force only interacts with
left handed fermions, and as such is maximally parity violating. The right
handed projections $\psi_{R}$
transform as singlet states, which are invariant under $SU(2)_{L}$.

The physical $\gamma, \PZ$ and $\PWpm$ bosons result from mixing between the gauge
fields:

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} A_{\mu} \\ Z_{\mu}^{0} \end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} \cos{\theta_{W}} & \sin{\theta_{W}} \\ -\sin{\theta_{W}} &
\cos{\theta_{W}} \end{pmatrix} . 
\begin{pmatrix} B_{\mu} \\ W_{\mu}^{3} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $A_{\mu}$ is the photon field, $Z_{\mu}^{0}$ is the $\PZ$ field
and $\theta_{W}$ is the weak mixing angle,
which can be related to the couplings of the weak neutral ($g$) and electromagnetic
interactions ($g'$) as $\theta_{W}=\tan^{-1}{\frac{g'}{g}}$. The fields
corresponding to the $\PWpm$ bosons are related to the weak isospin fields as
$W_{\mu}^{\pm} = (1/\sqrt{2})(W_{\mu}^{1} \mp W_{\mu}^{2})$. Weak neutral
currents were discovered at the Gargamelle bubble chamber experiment in CERN in
1973 \cite{Hasert:1973ff}, and the $\PZ$ and $\PWpm$ bosons themselves were
discovered by the UA1 and UA2 collaborations at CERN in
1983~\cite{Arnison:1983rp,Banner:1983jy,Arnison:1983mk,Bagnaia:1983zx}.

Crucially, this leads to a Lagrangian which doesn't contain any mass terms.
Gauge mass terms of the form $-M^{2}W_{\mu}W^{\mu}$ break the gauge invariance
of the Lagrangian. Similarly fermion mass terms of the form
$-m\overline{\psi}\psi = -m(\overline{\psi_{R}}\psi_{L} +
\overline{\psi_{L}}\psi_{R})$, where $\overline\psi$ indicates the adjoint of
the field, contain field pairs of left and right handed components which transform differently
under the $SU(2)_{L}$ and $U(1)_{Y}$ groups, and so also break gauge invariance.
Experimental results confirm the photon to be massless, but the $\PW$ and $\PZ$
bosons have finite masses of $\approx80.4~\GeV$ and $\approx91.2~\GeV$
respectively, and the fermions also have a range of finite masses~\cite{PDG}. As
such the electroweak symmetry must be spontaneously broken. The mechanism of
electroweak symmetry breaking in the \ac{SM} is the Higgs mechanism.

\subsection{The Higgs Mechanism in the Standard Model}
\label{sec:SMHiggs}

A symmetry in a quantum field theory is spontaneously broken when the Lagrangian
itself remains invariant whilst the vacuum state does
not\cite{AitchisonGaugeTheories}. For electroweak
theory, this is achieved by introducing a complex scalar field which attains a
non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV)
\cite{Higgs:1964ia,Higgs:1964pj,Guralnik:1964eu,Higgs:1966ev,Kibble:1967sv}. 
This field is an $SU(2)$ doublet, defined as:
\begin{equation}
\phi = \begin{pmatrix}\phi^{+} \\ \phi^{0} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The electroweak Lagrangian can be written in the following simple form:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L_{EW}} = -\frac{1}{4}(\bf{F_{\mu\nu}}\cdot\bf{F^{\mu\nu}} +
G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu}), 
\end{equation}
where $\bf{F_{\mu\nu}}$ and $G_{\mu\nu}$ are the weak isospin and field strength
tensors respectively, related to the fields as:
\begin{equation}
\bf{F_{\mu\nu}} = \partial_{\mu} \bf{W_{\nu}} - \partial_{\nu}\bf{W_{\mu}} -
g\bf{W_{\mu}} \times \bf{W_{\nu}} , 
\end{equation}
where $\bf{W_{\mu}} = (W_{\mu}^{1},W_{\mu}^{2},W_{\mu}^{3})$. Introducing the
complex scalar field $\phi$ yields an additional term of the form:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L_{\phi}} = (D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dagger}(D^{\mu}\phi) - V(\phi), \\ 
\text{with} \quad D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} - \frac{1}{2}(igT_{i}W_{\mu}^{i} - ig'B_{\mu}),
\end{equation}
where $T_{i}$ are the $SU(2)$ group generators. The term $V(\phi)$ is the
potential term, given by:
\begin{equation}
V(\phi) = \lambda(\phi^{\dagger}\phi)^{2} - \mu_{SM}\phi^{\dagger}\phi,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ and $\mu_{SM}$ are constants parametrising the self-interactions
and masses of the scalar fields. The vacuum states correspond to the minima of
$V(\phi)$ with expectation values of $\bra{0}\phi\ket{0}$, which are given by:
\begin{equation}
\bra{0}\phi\ket{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ v \end{pmatrix}, \\
\text{with} \quad v=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{SM}^{2}}{\lambda}}.
\end{equation}
To obtain the physical particles, perturbations around the vacuum state are
considered. If $\theta_{i}$ and $\hat{H}$ represent small variations in the four
degrees of freedom of the field $\phi$ then:
\begin{equation}
\phi = exp(-i\theta_{i}T^{i}/2v)\left(\frac{0}{\frac{v+H_{SM}}{\sqrt{2}}} \right)
\end{equation}
An appropriate gauge transformation can set the phase fields $\theta_{i}$ to be
zero, leaving only $H_{SM}$. Inserting this into the Lagrangian, $H_{SM}$ is
identified as a scalar field with mass $\sqrt{2}\mu_{SM}$ and the $W_{\mu}^{\pm}$
and $Z_{\mu}^{0}$ fields acquire mass terms $m_{W}$ and $m_{Z}$ related by:
\begin{equation}
m_{W} = m_{Z}\cos{\theta_{W}}=\frac{gv}{2}. 
\end{equation}
Fermion mass terms are introduced via Yukawa interactions between the fermion
and Higgs fields, with the form:
\begin{equation}
-\lambda_{f}( \overline{\psi_{L}}\phi\psi_{R} +
\overline{\psi_{R}}\phi\psi_{L}),  
\label{eq:HiggsCoupling}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{f}$ is the coupling for each fermion. They are proportional to
the mass of the fermion $m_{f}$, such that heavier fermions have stronger
coupling to the Higgs boson. The \ac{SM} does not predict values for these
couplings, but they can be determined using the experimentally measured masses
of the fermions. The experimentally measured $\PW$ and $\PZ$ masses can be used
alongside measured value of the fine structure constant to determine
$\sin{\theta_{W}}^{2}$, $v$ and $g$, but the value of $\mu_{SM}$ cannot be
predicted. Hence the mass of the Higgs boson associated with the Higgs field,
$m_{H}=\sqrt{2}\mu_{SM}$, is not predicted by the \ac{SM}, either directly or
indirectly using previous experimental measurements.

\subsection{Searching for the SM Higgs boson}
\label{sec:LHCHiggs}

Since the mass of the Higgs boson is not directly predicted by the \ac{SM},
searches covering a wide range of potential masses must be performed.
The Higgs boson is produced in particle accelerators and searched for via a signature 
resulting from its decay to either fermions or bosons. The coupling of the
Higgs to a particular final state is determined as~\ref{eq:HiggsCoupling} and
dependent on both the mass of the Higgs boson and the mass of the final state
particles. 

Production of the Higgs boson occurs via the processes shown in
figure~\ref{fig:SMFeynmanDiagrams}

Despite its successes, the \ac{SM} is known to have some shortcomings. One concerns

\section{MSSM Models incorporating the LHC Higgs}
\label{sec:mssmbenchmarks}

With the discovery of a 125$~\GeV$ Higgs-like particle at the LHC, the number of
possible MSSM scenarios is reduced to those which can incorporate this boson
with its measured properties. This section details some possible MSSM scenarios
which can incorporate this 125$~\GeV$ boson, whilst also exhibiting interesting
phenomenology motivated by experimental measurements. In particular the
scenarios must fulfil the condition $m_{\PH} = 125 \pm 3~\GeV$ over a wide range
of parameter space, and satisfy the boundaries set by previous searches at LEP,
the Tevatron and the LHC. The $3~\GeV$ uncertainty on the Higgs mass is
dominated by theoretical uncertainties in the MSSM models. All of the scenarios 
considered are defined without allowing CP violation. The scenarios follow those
described in~\cite{MSSMScenarios}, with some small modifications. More detail
can be found in~\cite{HIG-13-021}, where these scenarios are discussed in the context
of the MSSM $\Pphi \to \Pgt\Pgt$ analysis, which is discussed in
chapter~\ref{chap:htt-mssm}. 

As described previously, at tree level the masses of the five Higgs bosons are
defined by $m_{\PA}$ and $\tan\beta$. These masses are adjusted via radiative
corrections, necessary to produce a Higgs with mass consistent with $125~\GeV$.
The parameters of interest in these radiative corrections are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The mass of the top quark, $m_{\Pqt}$.
\item The mass of the bottom quark, $m_{\Pqb}$.
\item The mass of the 3rd generation squarks: stops and sbottoms, given by
$M_{\text{SUSY}}$.
\item The higgsino mass parameter, $\mu$.
\item The mass of the 3rd generation sleptons: the staus, given by
$M_{\PSlepton_{3}}$.
\item The $U(1)$ gaugino mass parameter, $M_{1}$.
\item The $SU(2)$ gaugino mass parameter, $M_{2}$.
\item The trilinear couplings of the stops, sbottoms and staus, $A_{\Pqt}$,
$A_{\Pqb}$ and $A_{\Pgt}$.
\item The mixing parameters of the stops, sbottoms and staus, $X_{\Pqt}$,
$X_{\Pqb}$ and $X_{\Pgt}$.
\end{itemize}

The dependence on these parameters can be reduced by exploiting relations
between them. For most scenarios, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are assumed to be related
at the GUT scale as:

\begin{equation}
M_{1} = \frac{5}{3}\frac{{\sin{\theta_{W}}}^{2}}{{\cos{\theta_{W}}}^{2}} M_{2},
\label{eq:GUTrelation}
\end{equation}

with $\sin{\theta_{W}} = \sqrt{1-{\cos{\theta_{W}}}^{2}}$ and 
$\cos{\theta_{W} = \frac{m_{W}}{m_{Z}}}$. Also
the mixing parameters $X_{i}$ ($i=\Pqt,\Pqb or
\Pgt$), the trilinear couplings $A_{i}$ and the higgsino mass parameter $\mu$ 
are related to the off-diagonal elements of the mixing matrices in the
stop, sbottom or stau sector as:
\begin{equation}
X_{\Pqt} = A_{\Pqt} -\mu\cot\beta, \quad X_{\Pqb} = A_{\Pqb} -\mu\tan\beta,
\quad X_{\Pgt} = A_{\Pgt} -\mu\tan\beta .
\end{equation}

Thus the list of parameters upon which the following MSSM scenarios depend is
reduced to: $m_{\PA}$, $\tan\beta$, $m_{\Pqt}$, $m_{\Pqb}$, $M_{\text{SUSY}}$,
$\mu$, $M_{\PSlepton_{3}}$, $M_{2}$, $A_{\Pqt}$, $A_{\Pqb}$, $A_{\Pgt}$ and
$X_{\Pqt}$. Finally the following parameters have only a very small effect on
the MSSM Higgs boson sector, and are fixed at chosen values which are compatible
with the current exclusion limits in direct searches:

\begin{itemize}
\item Masses of the first and second generation squarks, $M_{\Psquark_{1,2}} =
1500~\GeV$.
\item Masses of the first and second generation sleptons,  $M_{\PSlepton_{1,2}}
= 500~\GeV$.
\item Trilinear couplings of the first and second generation squarks and
leptons, $A_{f} = 0$.
\end{itemize}

A summary of the scenarios considered is given in table
\ref{tab:mssmbenchmarks}, and a short description of each is given in the
following sections.

\subsubsection{The $m_{h}^{\text{max}}$ scenario}
\label{sec:mhmaxscenario}

The $m_{h}^{\text{max}}$ scenario corresponds to the maximisation of the mass of
the lightest scalar Higgs as described in equation~\ref{}, for high $\PA$ and
$\tan\beta$. In this scenario the ratio of the stop mixing parameter and the
masses of the third generation squarks is chosen equal to 2
($|X_{\Pqt}/M_{\text{SUSY}}| = 2$). This scenario was used for results at LEP
and early LHC searches. 

In light of the $125~\GeV$ boson discovery, this scenario becomes less relevent,
since there is only a small amount of parameter space where this maximised light
Higgs mass is consistent with $125~\GeV$. Figure~\ref{fig:mhmaxmass} indicates
the region ruled out by this constraint. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{plots/theory/cmb_mhmax-HypoTest.pdf}
\caption{Region of $m_{\PA}$-$\tan\beta$ space which yields a Higgs mass not
consistent with $125~\GeV$ in the $m_{h}^{\text{max}}$ scenario.}
\label{fig:mhmaxmass}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The $m_{h}^{\text{mod}}$ scenario}
\label{sec:mhmodscenario}

As the name suggests, the $m_{h}^{\text{mod}}$ is a slightly modified version of
the $m_{h}^{\text{max}}$, such that the mass of the light Higgs is consistent
with $125~\GeV$ over a much wider range of phase space. This is achieved by
decreasing the ratio of the stop mixing parameter and the masses of the third
generation squarks, $|X_{\Pqt}/M_{\text{SUSY}}|$. In the $m_{h}^{\text{mod+}}$
scenario, the stop mixing is positive, $X_{\Pqt} = 1.5 \cdot M_{\text{SUSY}}$,
which gives better agreement with the experimental measurements of $(g-2)_{\mu}$
\cite{Miller:2007kk}. In the $m_{h}^{\text{mod-}}$ scenario, the stop mixing parameter is
negative, $X_{\Pqt} = -1.9 \cdot M_{\text{SUSY}}$, which results in a
BR($\Pqb\to\Pqs\Pphoton$) with better agreement with measurements
\cite{Lees:2012wg}.

Figure \ref{fig:mhmodmass} indicates the region of parameter space which yields
a Higgs consistent with $125~\GeV$. It can be seen that the area is a lot larger
than in the $m_{h}^{\text{max}}$ case. In all subsequent scenarios, the allowed
region is very similar, excluding only very low $\tan\beta$ values. For the
other scenarios these allowed regions are shown in chapter~\ref{chap:htt-mssm},
in the context of the results of the MSSM $\Pphi \to \Pgt\Pgt$ analysis which
are interpreted in these scenarios.

s$m_{h}^{\text{mod-}}$ (right) scenarios.}
\label{fig:mhmodmass}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The light stop scenario}
\label{sec:lightstopscenario}

The mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs depends logarithmically on the stop mass,
and therefore a value of $125~\GeV$ can be reached even with values of
$M_{\text{SUSY}} < 1~\TeV$ provided the mixing in the stop sector is large. This
leads to light stops, which could modify the gluon-fusion Higgs production rate.
Such a scenario is referred to as the light-stop scenario. This scenario is
defined to be in agreement with current results of direct searches for stops.
Note that in this scenario $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are not related by the GUT
relation in equation~\ref{eq:GUTrelation}. 
%An assumption used for the calculation of cross-sections in this scenario assumes
%that $m_{\PH} < 2\times $

\subsubsection{The light stau scenario}
\label{sec:lightstauscenario}

The light stau scenario is motivated by the excess of events in the decay
channel of the $\PH\to\Pphoton\Pphoton$ measured by ATLAS
\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2013-012}. Light staus
lead to a modification of the ratio of the lightest Higgs boson decaying into
two photons with respect to the \ac{SM} expectation:
\begin{equation}
r_{\Pphoton\Pphoton} =
\frac{\Gamma(\Ph\to\Pphoton\Pphoton)_{\text{MSSM}}}{\Gamma(\Ph\to\Pphoton\Pphoton)_{\text{SM}}}
.
\end{equation}

For high values of $\tan\beta$ and $m_{\PA}$ this ratio can be as high as 1.3. 

\subsubsection{The $\Pgt$-phobic scenario}
\label{sec:tauphobicscenario}

Similarly to the case of the light stau scenario, the $\Pgt$-phobic scenario is
motivated by the possibility to allow reduced couplings to down-type fermions.
In high $\tan\beta$ and $m_{\PA}$, the ratios:
\begin{equation}
r_{\Pqb\Pqb} =
\frac{\Gamma(\Ph\to\Pqb\Pqb)_{\text{MSSM}}}{\Gamma(\Ph\to\Pqb\Pqb)_{\text{SM}}}
, \quad
r_{\Pgt\Pgt} =
\frac{\Gamma(\Ph\to\Pgt\Pgt)_{\text{MSSM}}}{\Gamma(\Ph\to\Pgt\Pgt)_{\text{SM}}}
\end{equation}

can be significantly lower than 1.

\subsubsection{The low-$m_{\PH}$ scenario}
\label{sec:lowmHscenario}

The low-$m_{\PH}$ scenario is somewhat different from the other scenarios due to
the fact that in this scenario, the Higgs boson with mass of $125~\GeV$ is
assumed to be the heavier scalar Higgs $\PH$. This means that the mass of the
pseudoscalar Higgs must be chosen to be not too high, and is fixed at $m_{\PA} =
110~\GeV$. Since $m_{\PA}$ is fixed in this scenario, the 2-D parameter space
for the scan is chosen as $\mu$-$\tan\beta$, with $\mu$ varied between 300 and
$3100~\GeV$ and $\tan\beta$ between 1.5 and 9.5. All the other parameters are
very similar to those in the $\Pgt$-phobic scenario. In this scenario, the
couplings of the lightest Higgs boson $\Ph$ to gauge bosons is significantly
reduced compared with the \ac{SM} expectations by a factor 2-10, to ensure that
the \Ph is not already excluded by LEP limits.

\subsection{Modification of MSSM models at low $\tan\beta$}
\label{sec:lowtanbscenario}

In all of the scenarios discussed in the previous sections, the mass of either
the lighter or heavier scalar Higgs boson is consistent with $125~\GeV$ over a
wide range of phase space. However, one thing common to all of these scenarios
is the fact that in general the mass is not consistent at very low $\tan\beta$
values, where the mass of the lightest Higgs becomes too light to be consistent
with $125Z\GeV$. As results such as those discussed in chapter~\ref{chap:htt-mssm} 
rule out larger regions of phase space at high $\tan\beta$, attention turns to this low
$\tan\beta$ region and analyses which could access it.
