\chapter{Search for Standard Model H$\rightarrow\tau\tau$}
\label{chap:httSM}

As described in chapter \ref{chap:theory}, the Higgs boson is the final missing 
piece of the Standard Model of particle physics. In order to complete the SM, 
this Higgs boson should have all the predicted properties of the Standard Model
Higgs, including decaying to tau leptons at the predicted rate. Thus this
chapter describes the search for the Higgs boson of the Standard Model 
decaying into two tau leptons.

Plan for layout:
-Introduction
-Objects/triggers (refers back to previous chapters)
-Background estimation-->mostly data driven but point out where MC is needed -->
tag and probe, few pages.
-categories
-svfit?
-control plots (pre fit)
-systematics (brief)

Interpretation (maybe separate chapter)
-fit and pulls
-limit and significance
-Other important statistical results
